# Syntax Highlighting in Xcode

1. Run UTI.app (it will just close instantly)
2. Quit and reopen Xcode

Xcode, and all of macOS, will now recognize several file types including gravity, tsj, and tsm, which will cause Xcode to show syntax highlighting.
The source code for UTI.app is also available if you prefer to make it yourself.
