## What is Gate Engine?
Gate Engine is a cross platform game engine for Swift that allows you to build 2D and 3D games. 
</br>It includes simple APIs for loading resources, handling user inputs, and rendering content.

## Getting Started
A suite of example projects is available at [Gate Engine Demos](https://github.com/STREGAsGate/GateEngineDemos.git).

## Notice:
This package is very much in Beta. The API surface will be changing, possibly substantially. </br>
Once a versioned release is made the project will use Swift's availability API for deprecations and easy migration.</br>
However, in the mean time please be aware that pulling updates may break your project and require some fixes.

## Supported Platforms:
- [ ] Windows 10/11
- [x] macOS
- [ ] Linux/Steam Deck
- [x] iOS/tvOS
- [x] HTML5 (in Alpha)
- [ ] Android
